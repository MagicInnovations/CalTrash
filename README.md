### Executive Summary:

CalTrash is a community-driven project with a critical mission: enhancing the transparency and management of trash data in our neighborhoods. Specifically, we are focusing on Capitol Hill, Seattle, where there has been a noticeable and troubling increase in litter across sidewalks, streets, and parks.

### The Issue:

Residents, particularly pet owners, are facing challenges due to the escalating trash problem. The safety and cleanliness of our community are at stake, as people have to be vigilant to prevent their pets from interacting with harmful waste. This issue extends beyond mere inconvenience; it poses a health and safety risk to our community and its beloved pets.

### Additional Concern: Inadequate Waste Management Infrastructure

A parallel concern is the inadequacy of our current waste management infrastructure. Many neighborhoods are experiencing a shortage of operational waste bins, compounding the litter problem. Some existing bins are either insufficient in number or no longer functional, hindering effective waste disposal.

### Our Approach: Data-Driven Solutions

To address these challenges, we have initiated a data-driven approach:

-   **Raw Data Collection**: We are compiling data on trash hotspots, bin conditions, and litter types. This data is accessible [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFPjMkVnRQi6as1qGvQsbaKeTgdKxupL9XdL9IUtv-I/edit?usp=sharing).
    
-   **Interactive Mapping**: A visual representation of the issue is available through our interactive map of Seattle, highlighting key areas affected by the trash problem. View the map [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1DtLzl5Sq5eihWlO05rAGwKfivuxQLyY&usp=sharing).
    

### Call to Action:

We invite community members to join us in this endeavor. Your participation, whether through data contribution, clean-up efforts, or spreading awareness, is invaluable in making our neighborhood a cleaner, safer place for everyone.

Together, let's tackle the trash issue head-on and restore the beauty and livability of Capitol Hill, Seattle.
